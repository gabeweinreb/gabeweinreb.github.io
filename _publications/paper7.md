Question: How do treatment patterns and outcomes for older patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction differ for low- vs high-income individuals across 6 countries.

Findings: In this study of 289 376 patients aged 66 years or older hospitalized with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 843 046 hospitalized with non-STEMI across 6 health systems, adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were higher for low-income patients, whereas rates of cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary interventions were lower. High-income patients also had shorter length of stay and lower rates of readmissions.

Meaning: These results suggest that income-based disparities were present even in countries with universal health insurance and robust social safety net systems.
