Question: Among Medicare beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction (MI) from 2009-2018, did outcomes and treatment processes differ for patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage as compared with traditional Medicare?

Findings: In this retrospective cohort study that included 557 309 participants hospitalized with ST-segment elevation [acute] MI (STEMI) and 1 670 193 with non–ST-segment elevation [acute] MI (NSTEMI), enrollment in Medicare Advantage, compared with traditional Medicare, was associated with significantly lower adjusted 30-day mortality rates in 2009 (with STEMI: Medicare Advantage [19.1%] vs traditional Medicare [20.6%]; with NSTEMI: Medicare Advantage [12.0%] vs traditional Medicare [12.5%]). By 2018, mortality had declined in all groups, and there were no longer statistically significant differences between Medicare Advantage (17.7%) and traditional Medicare (17.8%) for STEMI or for NSTEMI (Medicare Advantage [10.9%] vs traditional Medicare [11.1%]).

Meaning: Enrollment in Medicare Advantage, compared with traditional Medicare, was associated with modestly lower rates of 30-day mortality following acute MI in 2009, and the difference was no longer statistically significant by 2018.
