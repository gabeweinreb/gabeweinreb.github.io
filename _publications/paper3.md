BACKGROUND: Sex differences in acute myocardial infarction treatment and outcomes are well documented, but it is unclear
whether differences are consistent across countries. The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology, use of
interventional procedures, and outcomes for older females and males hospitalized with ST-segment–elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI) and non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in 6 diverse countries.

METHODS: We conducted a serial cross-sectional cohort study of 1 508 205 adults aged ≥66 years hospitalized with STEMI
and NSTEMI between 2011 and 2018 in the United States, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and Israel using
administrative data. We compared females and males within each country with respect to age-standardized hospitalization
rates, rates of cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery within
90 days of hospitalization, and 30-day age- and comorbidity-adjusted mortality.

RESULTS: Hospitalization rates for STEMI and NSTEMI decreased between 2011 and 2018 in all countries, although the
hospitalization rate ratio (rate in males/rate in females) increased in virtually all countries (eg, US STEMI ratio, 1.58:1 in 2011
and 1.73:1 in 2018; Israel NSTEMI ratio, 1.71:1 in 2011 and 2.11:1 in 2018). Rates of cardiac catheterization, percutaneous
coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery were lower for females than males for STEMI in all countries
and years (eg, US cardiac catheterization in 2018, 88.6% for females versus 91.5% for males; Israel percutaneous coronary
intervention in 2018, 76.7% for females versus 84.8% for males) with similar findings for NSTEMI. Adjusted mortality for
STEMI in 2018 was higher for females than males in 5 countries (the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Israel, and
Taiwan) but lower for females than males in 5 countries for NSTEMI.

CONCLUSIONS: We observed a larger decline in acute myocardial infarction hospitalizations for females than males between
2011 and 2018. Females were less likely to receive cardiac interventions and had higher mortality after STEMI. Sex disparities
seem to transcend borders, raising questions about the underlying causes and remedies.
