I am a second-year PhD student in the Health Policy and Management program at Harvard Business School where my advisor is Dr. Rob Huckman. I live in Brookline with my fiance Natalie and our two cats, Joe and Huey. Before grad school I was a research assistant in the Health Care Policy department at Harvard Medical School, working for Dr. Bruce Landon and Dr. J. Michael McWilliams. Before that I was a management consultant for three years in McKinsey's New York office.

Research
======
The main theme of my research is the role of expert knowledge in the firm. How is expertise developed and transmitted? How much deference is paid to it? In the health care context, I am most interested in the tension between doctors' professional autonomy and managers' traditional prerogatives. For example, an overly thorough approach to care or diagnostics could conflict with value-based payment incentives. More broadly, I think about how credentialled professionals shape our economic insititutions (e.g., accountants developing GAAP, physicians influencing medical payment rates), how they operate independent firms, and the discretion they exercise when embedded in corporations. In practice, I have one research program about physician training and skill development and another about physician agency and decision-making.

Consulting
======
I have been an external advisor to McKinsey since leaving the Firm in 2021. I am open to new opportunities to advise health care clients, policy organizations, and governments.

In my first two years at McKinsey I spent 80% of my time serving health care clients (payers, providers, and health tech vendors) and 20% serving wealth management and brokerage clients. I focused on growth strategy, digital strategy and health systems' COVID-19 response. In my third year I was a Fellow in McKinsey's [Center for US Healthcare Improvement](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/how-we-help-clients/center-for-us-healthcare-improvement) where I advised clients on health care poliy developments. I focused on the [Medicare program](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/new-stars-ratings-for-medicare-advantage-prioritize-customer-experiences), the 2020 US presidential election, and COVID-19 era fiscal stimulus and deregulation. As an external advisor I have surveyed state Medicaid payment policies for a home care provider, developed alternative business models for a PBM, supported the development of a state Medicaid program's value-based payment policy, and diligenced a large health tech asset for a private equity buyer.
