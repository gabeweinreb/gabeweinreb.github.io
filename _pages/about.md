I am a second-year PhD student in the Health Policy and Management program at Harvard Business School. I live in Brookline with my fiance Natalie and our two cats, Joe and Huey. Before grad school I was a research assistant in the Health Care Policy department at Harvard Medical School, working for Dr. Bruce Landon and Dr. J. Michael McWilliams. Before that I was a management consultant for three years in McKinsey's New York office.

Research
======
I try to pursue two major threads in my research. The first is the role of expert knowledge in the business firm: how expertise is developed, how it is transmitted, and what -- if any -- deference is paid to it. In the health care context, I am most interested in the tension between doctors' professional autonomy to rely on their expertise and managers' prerogative to optimize health system performance. For example, an overly thorough approach to care or diagnostics could conflict with value-based payment incentives. More broadly, I think about how credentialled professionals shape our economic insititutions (e.g., accountants developing GAAP, physicians influencing medical payment rates), how they operate independent firms, and the discretion they exercise when embedded in corporations. In practice, I have one research program about physician training and skill development and another about physician agency and decision-making.

The second thread...
